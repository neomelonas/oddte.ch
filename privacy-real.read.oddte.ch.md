# Privacy Policy

Anything you post here will be living in/on/around the server that @neo runs. Baring any unforseen (legal) circumstances, @neo will not be looking at your private data. Unfortunately, this is very much a "trust me, bro" policy, but it is what it is.

Since the underlying software for this site, Bookwyrm, is federated with other ActivityPub leveraging systems, anything you do here that isn't kept inside your head will potentially be seen by others on the internet. The whole point of federating a bunch of servers together is to broaden the reach of the thing you posted here, so, honestly, you should have expected this. We cannot guarantee who or what or how much of whatever is seen by anyone, anywhere.

If you want decent privacy (the info doesn't leave this server), the only way to do that is to set your account to private, only accept friend requests from other friend.camp users, and only ever use our "local-only" posting mode which you learned about in your onboarding. Once you start talking to people on other servers, all bets are off. Any private message you send to someone on another server could be looked at by the admin of a different server.
